// Use a factory in situations where you don't necessarily want to return a new instance of the class itself. Use cases:

// the constructor is expensive, so you want to return an existing instance - if possible - instead of creating a new one;
// you only ever want to create one instance of a class (the singleton pattern);
// you want to return a subclass instance instead of the class itself.
